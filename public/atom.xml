<p><a href="http://www.asknubia.com/how-to-change-the-explorer-sport-trac-tail-lights/picture1/"  rel="attachment wp-att-14"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14" alt="Picture1" src="http://www.asknubia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Picture1-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span id="more-12"></span><br />
Tools you need:</p>
<p>- Ratchet<br />
- 8mm socket<br />
- Flat head screwdriver<br />
- Lubricant (optional)<br />
- Metallic container with magnet (optional)<br />
- Transparent black spray paint (optional)<br />
- Newspaper (optional)</p>
<p>1. GENTLY take off the rubber seals using the screwdriver if needed. These seals keep the dust from coming into your light covers. At the end you may want to put them back on so that they keep protecting to some extent your cover and light bulb from environmental aging.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asknubia.com/how-to-change-the-explorer-sport-trac-tail-lights/tail-ligjt-3/"  rel="attachment wp-att-16"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16" alt="tail ligjt 3" src="http://www.asknubia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tail-ligjt-3-300x158.jpg" width="300" height="158" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Take the ratchet with the 8mm socket and remove the screws to loosen the cover. The screws are now exposed after removing the plastic seals. I strongly recommend that you have a metallic container with a magnet where you can place the screws while not in use. It is a pain in my behind every time I keep things in my pockets and at the end I can’t find them. The magnetic container is the best, saves you time!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asknubia.com/how-to-change-the-explorer-sport-trac-tail-lights/picture1-2/"  rel="attachment wp-att-32"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-32" alt="Picture1" src="http://www.asknubia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Picture1-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://www.asknubia.com/how-to-change-the-explorer-sport-trac-tail-lights/picture2-2/"  rel="attachment wp-att-33"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33" alt="Picture2" src="http://www.asknubia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Picture2-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Carefully pull the cover towards you not too strong because the light bulbs are still plugged. Again, be gentle at the time of disassembling. Some vehicles have hooks (mostly plastic hooks) to hold parts in place and you want to avoid breaking them so that you can put everything firmly back in place when you are done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Trying not to touch the bulbs, unplug the top and bottom light bulbs by twisting and pulling back as follows (not disconnecting the light bulb unless you want to change a blown bulb):</p>

<p>In this particular case I wanted to leave the same light covers so I sprayed them with a transparent black paint. If you want to do so, consider safety: paint up to a black tone that allows your brake lights to be seen. Spray paint can improve your tail lights’ appearance or can ruin it depending on the painting job. If you can, I recommend that you paint the inside of your light covers.</p>
<p>5. Clean the surface that you will be working on. You can use soap and water and then dry completely. The idea is to leave a particulate free surface.</p>
<p>6. Place the light covers in a place without air flow and if needed, cover the area with newspaper.</p>
<p>7. Slightly spray a paint layer at approximately 30 cm from the surface that you are painting (this varies depending on the spray’s sprinkler). Here you look for a difused finish. Let that layer dry and keep spraying layers until you get the black tone of your desire. Consider that you may end up with a different effect than the one shown below because these covers had old paint behind.</p>

<p>8. Let the light covers dry in a room without air flow.  Meanwhile, get everything ready to put the covers back on.</p>
<p>9. Replace or clean the rubber sealers and lubricate them, but don’t leave them oily as dust will stick on them. I used WD-40<sub>®.</sub></p>

<p>11. Once dry, place the light covers back in place. Find how the bulb’s plastic tridented base fits the cover, put the bulb inside the hole and twist it.</p>

<p>How to disassemble to improve the explorer sport trac tail lights</p>

<p>Posted in Cars on 02/28/2012 08:26 pm by nubia
My sport trac tail light covers needed maintenance replacement. I decided to spray paint them. This post shows how to take the covers off and back on.</p>

<li><p>GENTLY take off the rubber seals using the screwdriver if needed. These seals keep the dust from coming into your light covers. At the end you may want to put them back on so that they keep protecting to some extent your cover and light bulb from environmental aging.</p></li>

<div>
    – Me: My car is without a heart 
</div>


<div>
    – Mechanic: Not only that, is so empty that it does not even have a soul!
</div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_no_engine.png" width="1000" height="268" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div>
My spyder’s broken heart:
</div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_broken_heart.png" width="400" height="400" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div>
The story started with a constant “click click” noise that bothered me even though the car performed ok.  With ok I mean reasonably, but not as I wish it to respond when increasing rpms.  Check engine light went on, oil was “disappearing” and the car warmed over the limit, but the temperature gauge was showing normal temperature.  I noticed the car was hotter than it should because the plastic covers for the shocks/struts next to the engine showed signs of molten plastic (plastics were deformed).
</div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>
    The mechanic had to open the engine and this is what we found:
</div>


<p><img class="left" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_unmounted_engine.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images">
<img class="right" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_unmounted_engine_2.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>




<div>
    One piston was hitting the walls of the cylinder and due to the conditions of the engine I decided to go for an overhaul.  I bought slightly bigger pistons (0.2) instead of the standards (0.18).  Worn signs can be observed in the old piston (right) in comparison to the new piston (left).
</div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_pistons.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div>
    The engine block went to a machine shop to widen the cylinders’ diameter:
</div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_measuring_pistons.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div>
    I also acquired new valves, gaskets, seals.  Especially important is the main oil seal (between the engine and the transmission) that once it goes bad, is expensive to replace due to labor that requires removing the engine to reach the cheap seal.  For that reason, even though mine looked ok, I decided to change the seal as a preventive service.  Plastic parts that degrade with time and leaks can happen.  From the materials point of view polymers are prone to degradation due to environmental aging.  Specifically humidity (hydrogen and oxygen) and UV light attack and break the polymer chains.  Plastics then lose their mechanical properties such as flexibility and elasticity.  Therefore, rubber seals might not be performing properly after few years (I’ll guess after 5-10 years depending on variables such as maintenance, weather, etc.).  Following is the kit I bought from ebay:
</div>




<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_gasket_full_set.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div>
    When putting the engine back together, the mechanic noticed that the intake manifold had something inside.  I was able to put get my hand inside and discovered that an internal piece was broken ☹  Therefore, I also bought a manifold out of a corolla from a junk yard.
</div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_manifold.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div>
    Obviously spark plugs and ignition coils were changed for new DENSO ones.
</div>




<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>




<div>
    I thought of getting a new engine, but new was too expensive and the cheapest rebuilt was ~900dlls.  However, nothing would have been more satisfying than knowing step by step what is happening to the engine, the parts being replaced and the ones that stayed.
</div>


<p><img class="left" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_rebuilt_engine.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images">
<img class="right" src="http://asknubia.com/images/MR2/mr2_rebuilt_engine_2.png" width="320" height="320" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>




<div>
What still bothers me, is not knowing what was the root cause.  Why was the car overheating and not giving an alarm? Where was the oil in the intake manifold coming from? Was everything started from the broken part inside the manifold? How did it break??? Anyway, I’m very satisfied with the job done and every dollar spent was worth it.
</div>




<div>
After seeing the inside of this wonderful piece of engineering, I will spoil this car with deionized water and good quality oil. ☺
