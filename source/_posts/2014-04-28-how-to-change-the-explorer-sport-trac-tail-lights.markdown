Tools you need:</p>
<p>- Ratchet<br />
- 8mm socket<br />
- Flat head screwdriver<br />
- Lubricant (optional)<br />
- Metallic container with magnet (optional)<br />
- Transparent black spray paint (optional)<br />
- Newspaper (optional)</p>
<p>1. GENTLY take off the rubber seals using the screwdriver if needed. These seals keep the dust from coming into your light covers. At the end you may want to put them back on so that they keep protecting to some extent your cover and light bulb from environmental aging.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asknubia.com/how-to-change-the-explorer-sport-trac-tail-lights/tail-ligjt-3/"  rel="attachment wp-att-16"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16" alt="tail ligjt 3" src="http://www.asknubia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tail-ligjt-3-300x158.jpg" width="300" height="158" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Take the ratchet with the 8mm socket and remove the screws to loosen the cover. The screws are now exposed after removing the plastic seals. I strongly recommend that you have a metallic container with a magnet where you can place the screws while not in use. It is a pain in my behind every time I keep things in my pockets and at the end I can’t find them. The magnetic container is the best, saves you time!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Carefully pull the cover towards you not too strong because the light bulbs are still plugged. Again, be gentle at the time of disassembling. Some vehicles have hooks (mostly plastic hooks) to hold parts in place and you want to avoid breaking them so that you can put everything firmly back in place when you are done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Trying not to touch the bulbs, unplug the top and bottom light bulbs by twisting and pulling back as follows (not disconnecting the light bulb unless you want to change a blown bulb):</p>

<p>In this particular case I wanted to leave the same light covers so I sprayed them with a transparent black paint. If you want to do so, consider safety: paint up to a black tone that allows your brake lights to be seen. Spray paint can improve your tail lights’ appearance or can ruin it depending on the painting job. If you can, I recommend that you paint the inside of your light covers.</p>
<p>5. Clean the surface that you will be working on. You can use soap and water and then dry completely. The idea is to leave a particulate free surface.</p>
<p>6. Place the light covers in a place without air flow and if needed, cover the area with newspaper.</p>
<p>7. Slightly spray a paint layer at approximately 30 cm from the surface that you are painting (this varies depending on the spray’s sprinkler). Here you look for a difused finish. Let that layer dry and keep spraying layers until you get the black tone of your desire. Consider that you may end up with a different effect than the one shown below because these covers had old paint behind.</p>

<p>8. Let the light covers dry in a room without air flow.  Meanwhile, get everything ready to put the covers back on.</p>
<p>9. Replace or clean the rubber sealers and lubricate them, but don’t leave them oily as dust will stick on them. I used WD-40<sub>®.</sub></p>

How to disassemble to improve the explorer sport trac tail lights

Posted in Cars on 02/28/2012 08:26 pm by nubia
My sport trac tail light covers needed maintenance replacement. I decided to spray paint them. This post shows how to take the covers off and back on.

Tools you need:

- Ratchet
- 8mm socket
- Flat head screwdriver
- Lubricant (optional)
- Metallic container with magnet (optional)
- Transparent black spray paint (optional)
- Newspaper (optional)

1. GENTLY take off the rubber seals using the screwdriver if needed. These seals keep the dust from coming into your light covers. At the end you may want to put them back on so that they keep protecting to some extent your cover and light bulb from environmental aging.

I strongly recommend that you have a metallic container with a magnet where you can place the screws while not in use. It is a pain in my behind every time I keep things in my pockets and at the end I can’t find them. The magnetic container is the best, saves you time!
